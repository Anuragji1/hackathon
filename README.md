PROBLEM STATEMENT NUMBER = CBP20.
PROBLEM TITLE = Self-identifying the mental health status and get guidance for support.
Problem Statement Category: Fitness & Sports.

Problem Statement Description:
Considering the increasing burden of mental disorders (as evidenced in National Mental Health Survey-2016), it is important to identify people at the risk of developing mental disorders at an early stage to take the necessary action. Primary Health Care centres serve as gatekeepers of the Indian public health care delivery system and also provide an opportunity to screen patients for the risk of developing mental disorders. While some validated tools are available for screening individuals for the risk of developing psychiatric disorders, challenges such as ready availability, collecting responses from patients, interpretation, and providing quick guidance for taking action based on the interpretation of the tool score still exist. The expected output is a mobile application for screening mental health, targeted towards both the public and frontline health workers.

Ideas and Project Details:
Our project aims to address the challenges mentioned in the problem statement by developing a comprehensive mobile application for screening mental health. The application will feature an intuitive user interface for easy accessibility by both the general public and frontline health workers. Here's an overview of our project: -

Key Features:
User-friendly interface for seamless navigation.
Secure storage of personal information and screening responses.
Automated assessment of mental health status based on screening questions.
Immediate guidance and support based on assessment results.
Integration with existing health care systems for efficient data management.
